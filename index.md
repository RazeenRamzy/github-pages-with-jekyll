OOP is a programming-paradigm based upon the principle of "object technology", in which objects consist of data, on 
fields, often called characteristics; and source code, organized into methods. The method makes it possible for the 
object to access as well as edit the data fields of another object, which the existing object interacts with. In OOP, 
computer programs are designed by dividing it from the range of objects interacting with each other. Object oriented 
programming languages are quite diverse, mostly class-based programming languages, indicating that objects in these 
languages are dealt with as entities of a class, utilized to specify a data type. Some concepts to understand in the 
modern OOP language: Currently, one of the most popular OOP languages concentrate on classification methods 
consisting of C ++, Java, C # and also Visual Basic.NET. OOP, or object-oriented programming language, is a method of 
designing and developing software programs based upon object and class architecture.
